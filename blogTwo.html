        For those not in the know or rather hearing this name for the first time, be assured that youâ€™re in the familiar waters like many others, since he is a man who quietly goes about his job day in day out. Let me quickly shed some introduction on the man who is fondly called as 'The Infrastructure Man of India' and is the current Minister for Road Transport and Highways in the India. Oh and by the way, he is also the longest serving Minister for Transport in the government of India.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nitin Gadkari commands immense respect from the people all over the country including the opposition cadres and parties, since he is one of the cleanest politicians currently in the public service. The amount of progress India has achieved in the Infrastructure and Transport sector in the past seven years under his administration is unparalleled with record number of large projects commencing and finishing under tremendous timelines which were never heard of, before in this sector. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The golden age of Indian Transport and Highway infrastructure, which is the tenure of late Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee is also attributed to the vision of Nitin Gadkari who was the then Public Works Department (PWD) minister in the Vajpayee administration. Gadkari provided all-weather road connectivity in Maharashtra to 98% of the population connecting more than 13000 remote villages that had remain unconnected since pre-independence. He then submitted a detailed report based on succssful implementation of his pet project and convinced the government to launch the most decorated infrastructure project of India - 'Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana', an ambitious and well executed rural road connecting project worth more than 600 billion. He was someone who achieved great heights in the earliest stages of public life and the massive infrastructure projects that are rapidly taking shape in the past 7 years of his ministerial tenure are a testimony to his ever-increasing credentials as one of the most efficient politicians of India, putting him in the league of legends like Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Dr P V Narasimha Rao and others. 
      </p>
      <p>Let us wish he continues to reach new heights in public service and be able to serve the country for a very long time. I hope this blog has provided some insights on the decorated career of a great politician. Until next time!
      </p>
      <p>Yours Sunil</p>
