        Is Kohli the new Sachin? Is Kohli better than Sachin? These are questions that every cricket fan, especially the current generation in their teens and early 20s are sure to have come across in the past decade. These questions are here to stay on for the current decade and shall only get louder due to Kohli's consistent performances over the years.
        However, this is an easy debate for cricket followers from the 90s and early 2000s which includes me too :P, because for fans who have been closely following cricket for more than 2 decades, Sachin was and will always be the greatest batsman the game has ever seen. Some of the many, many facts to back this would be:- 

      </p>

      <h3>Quality of bowling</h3>
      <p>
        The plethora of legendary fast bowlers be it the Akrams, the Waqars, the McGraths and many more that Sachin had to face throughout his career. These were the bowlers who sent shivers down the spine to most batsmen of that era barring Sachin. Where as the current crops of bowlers are nowhere as skilful/dangerous compared to the bowlers from yesteryears. It is also important to note that the two best bowlers of this generation – Dale Steyn and James Anderson were in their mid-30s by the time Kohli started to face the music from them which tilts the balance ever so much towards Sachin. The mastery and quality of spin bowling that Warne and Muralitharan produced has never been matched by any other spinner in this era and Kohli has had a cakewalk in this aspect too.

      <h3>
        Technology and Modern rules of the game.
      </h3>
      <p>
        It is not a secret that Sachin was the most unfortunate batsman in the history of the game in terms of umpiring errors and horrific decisions. As a matter of fact, Sachin has been dismissed due to umpiring errors in at least 40 international matches, many of them coming when he was in the nervous 90s and 80s thus depriving him of well deserved centuries and match winning knocks. The modern bats have gotten bigger tilting the balance heavily in favour of the batsmen, and there are no strict rules governing this aspect of batsmanship. The grounds have become smaller in a bid to commercialise the game and make fours and sixes, the fanciest part of the game.  The technology equipment and optimal usage of statistics and data are massively helping current batsmen in their preparations and technical adjustments.

      <h3>
        Last but the most important parameter – PRESSURE!!!!
      </h3>
      <p>For most part of the 90s and early 2000s Sachin was the player who was carrying the team on his shoulders  and in the process was carrying the weight of expectations of a billion people on himself. More often than not, he was the team’s most prolific scorer in all the games that they won which goes on to show that Sachin was quite unfortunate to be part of such a team. Sachin never got the support that he would have liked to, when he was in his prime. This led to the team often losing many close and high-profile games even after Sachin performing significantly well, since the team never had a strong middle order nor finishers who could finish the games for India even from winning positions or positions of strength.
        Kohli on the other hand has been part of strong Indian squads from the beginning of his career till date. It is also important to note that Kohli was part of the strongest ever (world cup winning) Indian squad for more than 5 years right early in his career.
        </p>
        <p>I hope I have put to rest any doubts or thoughts, that the current generation of cricket followers have about the greatness of Sachin. I am open to any meaningful discussions on the same in the comments section, so please feel free to hit me up on the chat :) </p>
        <p>Thank you for reading!!</p>
